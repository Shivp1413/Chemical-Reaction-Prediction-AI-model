Chemical Reaction Prediction AI Model

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model to predict reaction yields based on data extracted from `.pbtxt` files. The steps involved are:

1. Data Parsing and Preprocessing: Extracting and preparing data from `.pbtxt` files for model training.
2. Model Training: Creating and training a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance on a test dataset.
